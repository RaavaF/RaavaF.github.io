Sweet! My own personal website. It was surprisingly easy using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the theme [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/). 

I created the site because the *.dev* top level domain was cool. That's it. But I'll lie and tell you that I wanted to learn what make websites tick. They require hard work if made by hand, but I wasn't going to write the HTML and styles myself. 

*In 2023?* No way. 

Turns out you can create websites using static website generators and Markdown. That's great because Markdown is awesome. I now write my daily planner in a Markdown file. Those lists and tables are pleasant to read. 

Regardless, I'm still new to web development, but it's better to start the fun then pretending you could.

Cheers, Oranges.
