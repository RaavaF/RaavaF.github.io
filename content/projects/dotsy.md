## A bot dedicated to looking at a dot

A while ago I decided to get back into programming. I thought a fun way of getting my grove back is through a discord bot.

This is Dotsy, she goes to [this website](https://gcpdot.com/) and uses selenium to scrape the color. You can see the color and its values with `/dot` on Discord or `!dot` on Revolt. She says Easter eggs on certain colors, and even changes her profile picture to match the dot. 

It's pretty crude and there's probably better ways of doing this as suggested by a guy on discord, but she gets the job done and that's all that matters.

By the way, the github embed links to a Revolt version of Dotsy. The Discord version was developed to be used in a small server, thus I haven't bothered making a github repo for it. It might happen later; no guarantees.
