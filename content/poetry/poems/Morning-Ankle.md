It's the third morning this week my body feels this way.  
The feeling of a Gordian knot tied to my ankle,  
The pressure pushing the hair against my skin  
Burning as if it was tinder used for a fire,  
Or stinging like rubbing alcohol was poured over a rash,  
The strangle festerslike yeast to bread.  

My stomach rots forcing my spine to contort into the shape of a harp,  
My insides woven, like a tied shoelace  
Jostling like a baby kicking,  
my emotions like a soccer ball  
but it keeps rebounding back  
like I'm playing tennis.  

I have to go to work today.  
And the day after that,  
And the day after that.  
Today I don't want to do anything.  

I had to count to ten just to enter my shower.  
And my tooth brush felt like an Excalibur that deemed me unworthy  
to move on with my life-  

I want, to take control, of my life!  

Yet life has strapped me to train tracks,  
mocking me because I cant solve my   
own trolley problems.  

I need to put on my shoes.  

But it seems like my hands are withering in front of me  
my eyes are foggy  
like they are in a horror movie.  

My thoughts are divorced parents  
and I'm just a child watching giants  
bicker on how they should control *my* story  
I need to move out of my *head-*  

Where is my other ear ring?  

I'm always losing things.  
I'm afraid my pleasures will ice skate away  
My friends hang gliding to escape me-  
God I hope my friends don't know I'm this way  
I can't even get dressed...  

Oh I left it on the dresser.  

Hey I wonder,  
If maybe,  
I'll be doomed to feel this way forever.  
Forced to drink this concoction of unforgiving monotony, misery, and shame,  
Every Monday, Tuesday,  
Week Month,  
Will I even get through another decade?!  

Am I turning mad?  

I wish I could blame someone,  
Yell at someone for causing my suffering,  
Really drill into every pore,  
a screw of bitterness,  
Force them to take pills of my resentment,  
But the only person I could hate  
Is myself.  

I feel the Gordian Knot grow tighter,  
My back fold clockwise,  
the train growing louder,  
My fist stronger,  
then weak again.  

I fall to the side of my bed.  

I chuckled,  
Then cried,  
Then chuckled more  

I feel like a commander who lost a battle to chickens.   
Except  worse,  
Because I lost a war against myself.   

I sink further towards the floor.  

Oh, that's where I left my keys.
