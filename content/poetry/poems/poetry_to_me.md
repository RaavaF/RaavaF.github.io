Poetry to me  
is if thugs dressed in steampunk   
walked on your ABC's  
asking if you said that really  
Poet really  

I just like different poetry,  
I get to catch Jazz symphonies
Or rock and roll ballets  

I like listening to people's theaters  
spitting out their inner Hamilton    

Sometimes we talk in rainbows  
sometimes we talk in tears  

Sometimes we're clear as windows  
Ripping our hearts open like a chip bag  
Boiling our emotions with the pot cover falling off

Sometimes we're foggy glasses  
Only giving the smell but not the taste  
Hearing the thunder but not seeing the lightning  
Feeling the passion but not the footprints that lead to it  

The way I see spoken word,  
is rhythms like shifting train tracks  
with a steel cabooses sliding on rusty metal  
Heavy dense but it's  lightweight   
locomotive still pushing
Cloud coming out  

like poof poof poof  

A journey your barely catching  
like your 5 minutes late  
"Conductor, wait up!"  
I got a ticket to golden ticket  
to sit and listen to the poet express   

And you want to hear it again  
read it again  
feel it again and again  
and again again again again

like a chug-a-da  
chug-a-da chug-a-da  
chug-a-da  

but it stops suddenly   
like you pulled the plug on a blender  

You know, poetry  
is if Sputnik was still orbital   
It's gravity shifting your eyes  
skybound  

Heat shield rickety  
shaking your hands   
knowing your words have a voice  

Spinning with your vision
thrusting with your images    

Like the fuel won't stop pumping
pumping  
love  
heart is beating  
but it's still pumping love  
like that's what poetry can be  

But sometimes it can just be funny  

make a friend laugh  

your humor  
your comedy  
like write a stand up honestly  

Or maybe you wanna write stanzas  
locked up in your notes app that will never see the light of day  

For me,  
right now writingâ€¦  

I just wanna write rhythms,   
as sharp as a bumblebee playing tag  

I just wanna write rhythms,   
that changes colors every time you blink  

I wanna write rhythms, that an desert oasis that's too hard to reach

I wanna write rhythms, like a tugged oxygen cord I'm forcing to squeeze  

I wanna write rhythms, I can't even spell  

I wanna write rhythms, that let me breath  

I wanna write rhythms, for me.  

And that's all that matters
