Humanity was forced underground.  

I'm a rock baby.  
The generation that's fit below earth,  
because society wasn't fit above it.  

Oxygen is limited here which is why  
its mandatory we scribble rather than squabble,  
so that the creepy spider webs of soot,  
doesn't crawl into lungs-  

It's crazy how our predecessors smoked for fun,   
but it isn't fun  
when thick,   
dense,   
opaque smog from machinery  
clouds your vision.  

This is why we write.  
When you suffocate to speak, you write.  
It's impolite to yap all the air in the O.X.Y regions of the city,  
so we write.  

And from our bristle misery I can say  
Humankind, upstairs,  
 should have put pen to paper a whole lot more.  
It gives you more cycles of a clock to get your emotions drawn.  

It gives you more time not to bicker   
when a clump of sharderd rocks could fall and cave in your home-  

This is why I asked my wife long ago to marry me through a book and quill.  

If someone can spend an eternity of 4 minutes to re-read 4 words  
Will you marry me,  
then she has considered every fiber of my being  

This is why if I ever,  
trip, stumble, slash gushing blood  
from my deepest cavern  
I'll know…  
That I at least put my blood  
on a page.  

Though I'm sure there's luxury,  
in air quality,  
for those generations forth  
who get to see the sun  

But for us rock babies,  
and I'm sure y'all will understand…  
That won't be our future.  

But I'm sure,  
Or well I hope,  
That we won't be forgotten,  
Because that is why we write.
