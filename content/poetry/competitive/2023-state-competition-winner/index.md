![Blue Watch](watch.jpg "The prize my team won at a state competition. A glossy blue watch with a wave pattern in it's center.")

My poetry team won big competition in my state! We won a nice watch for our efforts. This is not to the discredit of the other poetry teams. As much as it was a competition, it was a show of our artistry.

While I'm grateful I got to stand with a amazing crew, I still feel I could done better. I will be participating next year and hopefully show a bit more magic. 

I want to work hard on that.

Cheers, Lemons.
