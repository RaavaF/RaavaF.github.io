It's no secret that Chef-O-'Merica,  
Never got her salt or her pepper or her eggs from her own backyard,  

The grass on her front lawn is fake.  
Her door is missing a bolt.  
Yet she still wears the highest of heels,  
So you always have to look up at her,  

When cooking her spices from places unpronounceable,   
She mixes aliens and their culture and their dialects,  
‘Cause she knows she can’t cook nothing without them,  

That’s what O-’Merica always said, yes,  
And she hated that,  

She used to talk, and talk,   
and tell us that-  
She’s so sad that,  
The yolk!  
Always came a color not hers,  

And that the only recipe she could make was,  
Alien Scrambled Eggs.  

Oh-Mama-’Merica,   
I love those eggs,  
I tell her-  
I tell her-  
But she's so stubborn!  

She tries to wick and wash off  
those stains,  
those so called stain,  
That she brought up on herself,  

She doesn't know the gradient  
of beauty she made when cracking those   
shells,  

She's making omelets,  
Thicker than any dictionary worldwide,  
Full of seeds and fruit  
From other trees that not hers,  

None of this is her own.  

Yet she's good at mixing,  
Chopping,   
Tossing,  
The music,  
The drawings,  
The dreams of thousand at Ellis island.  

The view of future America,  
And future leader we imported out of state.  

She doesn't know the Spangled Banner,  
Contains our cries,  
From each star, in the navy skies,  
yelling from each red white stripe,  

I'm telling you mama!  

Don't throw those eggs,  
Those darn alien eggs,  
You used to call them.  

You shouldn't remove the views,  
of the youth who get to see how weak,  
you are without them,  

How you pretend you could of been here without 'em,  

You so great and gorgeous,  
Yet you check the cartons twice,  
To see anyone's different,  

Their sunny side is bright mama,  
 you just gotta give them a taste,  
Mama,   

Ma' O-'Merica.  

You throw em out  
You throw the whole soul in this house.  

And while I can taste the bitter in her mouth,  
She couldn't say no,  

That's why next day I got my favorite,  
Alien Scrambled Eggs and toast.
