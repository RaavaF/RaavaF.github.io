My own personal website. It was surprisingly easy using Hugo and the theme Blowfish.\nI created the site because the .dev top level domain was cool. That\u0026rsquo;s it. But I\u0026rsquo;ll lie and tell you that I wanted to learn what make websites tick. They require hard work if made by hand, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to write the HTML and styles myself.\nIn 2023? No way.\nTurns out you can create websites using static website generators and Markdown. That\u0026rsquo;s great because Markdown is awesome. I now write my daily planner in a Markdown file. Those lists and tables are pleasant to read.\nRegardless, I\u0026rsquo;m still new to web development, but it\u0026rsquo;s better to start the fun then pretending you could.\nCheers, Oranges.

I thought a fun way of getting my grove back is through a discord bot.\nThis is Dotsy, she goes to this website and uses selenium to scrape the color. You can see the color and its values with /dot on Discord or !dot on Revolt. She says Easter eggs on certain colors, and even changes her profile picture to match the dot.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s pretty crude and there\u0026rsquo;s probably better ways of doing this as suggested by a guy on discord, but she gets the job done and that\u0026rsquo;s all that matters.\nBy the way, the github embed links to a Revolt version of Dotsy. The Discord version was developed to be used in a small server, thus I haven\u0026rsquo;t bothered making a github repo for it. It might happen later; no guarantees.\nRaavaF/Dotsy A python Revolt bot for displaying the color of the Global Consciousness Project Dot Python 0 0 ","date":"15 April

people\u0026rsquo;s theaters\nspitting out their inner Hamilton\nSometimes we talk in rainbows\nsometimes we talk in tears\nSometimes we\u0026rsquo;re clear as windows\nRipping our hearts open like a chip bag\nBoiling our emotions with the pot cover falling off\nSometimes we\u0026rsquo;re foggy glasses\nOnly giving the smell but not the taste\nHearing the thunder but not seeing the lightning\nFeeling the passion but not the footprints that lead to it\nThe way I see spoken word,\nis rhythms like shifting train tracks\nwith a steel cabooses sliding on rusty metal\nHeavy dense but it\u0026rsquo;s lightweight\nlocomotive still pushing Cloud coming out\nlike poof poof poof\nA journey your barely catching\nlike your 5 minutes late\n\u0026ldquo;Conductor, wait up!\u0026rdquo;\nI got a ticket to golden ticket\nto sit and listen to the poet express\nAnd you want to hear it again\nread it again\nfeel it again and again\nand again again again again\nlike a chug-a-da\nchug-a-da chug-a-da\nchug-a-da\nbut it stops suddenly\nlike you pulled the plug on a blender\nYou know, poetry\nis if Sputnik was still orbital\nIt\u0026rsquo;s gravity shifting your eyes\nskybound\nHeat shield rickety\nshaking your hands\nknowing your words have a voice\nSpinning with your vision thrusting with your images\nLike the fuel won\u0026rsquo;t stop pumping pumping\nlove\nheart is beating\nbut it\u0026rsquo;s still pumping love\nlike that\u0026rsquo;s what poetry can be\nBut sometimes it can just be funny\nmake a friend laugh\nyour humor\nyour comedy\nlike write a stand up honestly\nOr maybe you wanna write stanzas\nlocked up in your notes app that will never see the light of day\nFor me,\nright now writing…\nI just wanna write rhythms,\nas sharp as a bumblebee playing tag\nI just wanna write rhythms,\nthat changes colors every time you blink\nI wanna write rhythms, that an desert oasis that\u0026rsquo;s too hard to reach\nI wanna write rhythms, like a tugged oxygen cord I\u0026rsquo;m forcing to squeeze\nI wanna write rhythms, I can\u0026rsquo;t even spell\nI wanna write rhythms, that let me breath\nI wanna write rhythms, for me.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s all that
